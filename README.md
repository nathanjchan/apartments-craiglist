In R, clean, explore, and analyze apartment listings web-scraped from Craigslist. Used ggplot2, ggmap, and stringr. Found different apartment costs in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco and how apartments and amenities differ depending on price and location. Important for new graduates and young adults looking to rent apartments.

Assignment 3 and 5 both feature graphics made in ggplot. Assignment 4 has graphics made in ggplot and ggmap. Assignment 5 has text cleaning and processing using stringr.

These three reports discuss questions and feature visualizations regarding
- effect of number of bedrooms/bathrooms/square footage on apartment price,
